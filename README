A program that simulates a bouncing ball.

The idea is that the ball should bounce differently depending on surface of
the floor, the material the ball is made of, gravity, air resistance and
some more factors.

This program neither finished nor working as intended. From the beginning it
was only an experiment in using Java graphics.
